    <h2>Ugali, the king of the Kenyan table</h2>
    <p>The ugali, composed of posho or sima, i.e. cornmeal and a side dish that can be meat, fish or vegetables, is the unique dish typical of Kenya and especially of the coast.
        The flour is boiled like our polenta, but in a shorter time so as not to consume coal or gas and fill the stomach more easily.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients (for upto six people)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tea cups of corn flour</li>
            <li>5 teacups of water</li> 
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>750 grams of spinach</li> 
            <li>4 ripe tomatoes</li>
            <li>Half onion</li>
            <li>A clove of garlic</li>
            <li>Half green pepper</li>
            <li>Three tablespoons of sunflower oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>STEPS:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the water over low heat and add salt.</li> 
            <li>Add the corn flour a little at a time, stirring continuously to prevent lumps from forming.</li> 
            <li>Cook until the water is completely absorbed.</li> 
            <li>Cover everything and cook over very low heat for another five minutes.</li>
            <li>Check the consistency of the polenta and, if completely solid, pour it into a tray. </li>
            <li>Cover with a damp cloth and serve warm.</li>
            <li>Cut the leaves of the vegetables into thin strips after washing them well, in a large and capacious pan, heat the oil and add the garlic and onion previously chopped.</li> 
             <li>After one minute add the diced tomatoes and fry over medium heat for three minutes.</li> 
            <li>Then throw the spinach in the pan, stir, cover and leave to fry for ten minutes, stirring occasionally.</li> 
            <li>The condensation formed by the cover of the pan is generally used as an additional sauce.</li> 
            <li>The cabbage is already finely cut at market stalls.</li>
            <li>There are several recipes for cooking cabbage, the simplest of which are the same ingredients used for other vegetables, some of which include the addition of spices such as cardamom to give it a more original and tasty flavor.</li>
        </ol>
